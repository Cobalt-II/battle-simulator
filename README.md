# battle-simulator
a basic 2d ctx battle simulator.

To install, simply download the files and run ```npm install express```. Then run ```node app``` to start the program.

This is a basic battle simulator where two teams fight. the player can place down "units" via mouseclick. To toggle the current unit, press the up or down arrow. To change the team sides, press p. To start or stop the battle, simply press enter when you are ready, and watch the magic happen. The code is pretty simple to edit if you want to make your own units too. A base example of given abilities, death events, and movement types are all laid out for you.

In this base version, there are 4 units (base, healer, infect, garg), 1 movement type (norm), 1 active ability (healing), and 2 death events (base, infect). Anyone who wishes can pretty easily add more however.
